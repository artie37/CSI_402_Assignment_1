This is a program that will take input from a file with strings. These strings will be input into a binary search tree. The first string will be the root of the tree and the following strings will be inserted into subtrees in alphabetical order. 

There will also be functions to compute the following:
a. The total number of strings in the input file.
b. The height of the binary search tree.
c. The number of leaves in the binary search tree.
d. The height of the left subtree of the root.
e. The number of strings in th left subtree of the root.
f. The height of the right subtree of the root.
g. The number of strings in th eright subtree of the root.
